Seattle Community Network Monitoring Daemon

I got fed up with working with librenms so I created my own push-based monitoring daemon.  The idea for it is for it to send metrics about like CPU and memory and network usage to a central system that aggregates all devices' monitoring data and users will be able to log into this system and view any device they want that is sending data. This repo is specifically about the sending portion though. There will be another repo that is the monitoring dashboard
